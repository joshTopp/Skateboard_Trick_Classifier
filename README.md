# Skateboard_Trick_Classifier
Using OpenCV and Yolo. Yolov8 to detect human and skateboard, then I extract Pose/keypoints. which makes a temporal model that classifies the trick.

Using OpenCV and Yolov8 right now once I expand there will definitely more.

CURRENT GOAL:
  Make it accurate with some basic tricks Ollie, Pop Shuv, and Kickflip

FUTURE GOALS:
  Expand to a lot more tricks that are more complex to classify
